# LongCOVID_App

Pace helps patients to self-manage their recovery process with an iPhone and Apple Watch app. Pace is distinctly different from the existing Long COVID applications in 2 key regards: (1) Pace is the first attempt to leverage wearable data in the Long COVID recovery app space, and (2) Instead of symptom-tracking, Pace focuses on motivating patients to find and accomplish appropriate daily activity goals.

From a technical standpoint, Pace is a native iOS and watchOS application. It is built with Swift 5 and frameworks such as SwiftUI, HealthKit, and Watch Connectivity. The code design is set up to allow maximum flexibility for the future builds, and Human Interface Guidelines informed the UI-related decisions. Pace is also a self-contained application, respecting patientâ€™s privacy.

The application is currently on the Build 1 cycle.
